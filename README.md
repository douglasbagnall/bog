Author clustering using multi-headed recurrent neural networks
==============================================================

This software was developed for the [PAN] 2016 [author clustering]
competition.

[pan]: http://pan.webis.de/
[author clustering]: http://pan.webis.de/clef16/pan16-web/author-identification.html

Bog is derived in part from [Caravel] which answers binary authorship
questions (within a particular competititon framework). Both use the
same underlying method and are based on the [recur] project.

There is a paper describing the approach at
